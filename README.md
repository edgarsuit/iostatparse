# iostatparse.py

**Usage:** `iostatparse.py [-h] file`

Parse the output of zpool iostat to generate summarized performance statistics


**Positional arguments:**

 `file` 		Text file containing the zpool iostat output to parse


**Details:**

Outputs 50th, 90th, 95th, 99th percentile and max value for performance statistics generated by zpool iostat command.
Performance statistics include R/W/Combined IOPS and throughput, I/O size, total R/W latency, and disk R/W latency.
Also calculates R/W mix, average I/O size, total data written across iostat interval, and average total written per
day.

**Sample Output:**
